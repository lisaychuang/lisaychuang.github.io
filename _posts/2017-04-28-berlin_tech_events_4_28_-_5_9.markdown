### Serverless computing with Andreas Nauerz (pm - 9:30pm)
Serverless computing (aka Function-as-a-Service) provides developers with a serverless deployment and operations model relieving them from the need to worry about complex infrastructural and operational tasks and allowing them to focus on developing value adding code.

We will also discuss some of our latest additions and illustrate how to benefit by “going” serverless with OpenWhisk by exploring some real-world customer usecases with a focus on how serverless architectures can be exploited for cognitive applications such as multimedia (images & videos) analysis & object detection, and conversational applications.

### The (almost) lost art of Smalltalk (7pm - 9pm)

Smalltalk is the grandfather of all Object-Oriented Programming languages. . Even 40 years after its inception, no other language can hold a candle to the elegance and purity of this dinosaur of computer science.

[You don't want to miss this talk ](https://www.meetup.com/Software-Craftsmanship-Berlin/events/239181028/)by Nikolas Martens (https://twitter.com/rtens_) on the origins of the paradigms that to this day influence so much of our work.

### Ranking and Recommendations Systems for Travel Search Engine (7pm - 9pm)
This talk describes the [factors affecting travel-site user behavior,](https://www.meetup.com/berlin-machine-learning/events/234989419/) how understanding that behavior can improve ranking & recommendation engines, and what the challenges are. 

By collecting information about user behaviors (e..g click through data, explicit feedback, page visit time) along with journeys and providers information, this is a good basis for building ML models for ranking and recommendation. The main challenges for building these models are: converting user implicit feedback (clickthrough data, page visit time) to reliable relevancy score; model selection; measuring model performance; and online learning (developing the model to incrementally improve over time).

### EmberJS Dual-Core: Tom Dale & Ricardo Mendes (7pm - 9pm)
[Meetup with two Ember.js Core members,](https://www.meetup.com/Ember-js-Berlin/events/239480902/) @tomdale (Tom Dale) and @locks (Ricardo Mendes).
